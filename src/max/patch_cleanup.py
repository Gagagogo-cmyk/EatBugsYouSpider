Gnumbat Max Patch — Dead Object Cleanup Script
============================================
Removes 25 dead objects left over from the multitrack upgrade.
These are the old segment-duration calculation chains
(unpack f f f → * → -) that were disconnected but never deleted
when slot_router.js took over that responsibility.

Dead objects removed:
  4 × unpack f f f  (no inputs)
  8 × *             (fed by unpack, output to dead -)
  4 × -             (no outputs)
  9 × label boxes   (durMs / endMs / StartMs, all orphaned)

Run from the MAX/ folder:
    python3 patch_cleanup.py
