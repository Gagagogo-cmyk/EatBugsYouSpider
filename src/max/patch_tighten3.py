Gnumbat Max Patch — Tighten-Up #3
================================
Fixes the double library-send / double t-SNE bug on patch load.

Root cause
----------
node.script ws_server.js already has @autostart 1, so ws_server starts the
instant the patch loads. A second path existed:

    loadbang (obj-437)  →  delay 2000  →  script start  →  ws_server

This fires a 'script start' 2 s after load — restarting ws_server mid-way
through the first buildIndex cycle. The TUI detects the disconnect,
reconnects, and sends another buildIndex 1.5 s later, triggering a second
full boot: 521 library chunks × 2, t-SNE × 2.

Fix: remove obj-437 (loadbang). The manual-restart button (obj-10) still
feeds the same delay 2000 → script start chain and is untouched.

Run from the MAX/ folder:
    python3 patch_tighten3.py
